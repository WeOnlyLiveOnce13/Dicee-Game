# Dicee-Game
A dice game built as a project in the course of web development by Dr. Angela Yu.

It is a test to myself after completing the intermediate Javascript and Document Object Model (DOM).
It showcases basic UI knowledge, intermediate CSS to style the web app and intermediate JavaScript to modify users names, modify dice images based on number generated, display animation and output aesthetic output.
